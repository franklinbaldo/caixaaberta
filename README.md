# What is Caixa Aberta?
Caixa Aberta is a script to scrap em compile realstate data from the Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal (CEF) official site.

# Why?
The CEF site is a great source of information, but it is not always easy to find the information you need.
Also, there is no history of the data, so it is hard follow what happened in the past.

# For who?
This script is for people who want to know what is happening in their city, state and country.
Scholars, students, real estate agents, financiers, etc.
